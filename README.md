## About InstallShield v3 (Z) archives
InstallShield Z format is a compressed archive format used by version 3 of the InstallShield installation software.

Z files can be recognized by their magic marker: `13 5D 65 8C 3A 01 02 00`.

Contained files are compressed with the "PKware implode" algorithm.
